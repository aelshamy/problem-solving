Print out the n-th entry in the fibonacci series.
The fibonacci series is an ordering of numbers where
each number is the sum of the preceding two.
For example, the sequence [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
forms the first ten entries of the fibonacci series.
Example:

## Examples

```js
fib(4) => 3
fib(5) => 5
fib(8) => 21
```
