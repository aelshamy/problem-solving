## Longest substring without repeating characters

Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Example 1:

```
Input   : "abcabcbb"
Output  : 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
```

Example 2:

```
Input   : "bbbbb"
Output  : 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```

Example 3:

```
Input   : "pwwkew"
Output  : 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
             Note that the answer must be a substring
             "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```

## Longest palindromic substring

Given a string s, find the longest palindromic subsequence's length in s. You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.

Example 1:

```
Input   : "bbbab"
Output  : 4
One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bbbb".
```

Example 2:

```
Input   : "cbbd"
Output  : 2
One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bb".
```

Constraints

```
1 <= s.length <= 1000
s consists only of lowercase English letters.
```
